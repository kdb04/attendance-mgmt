mvn spring-boot:run
```
This will start the Spring Boot server at `http://localhost:8080`

### Running the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`

### Database Configuration
Database connection parameters can be configured in:
```

backend/AttendanceManagementSystem/src/main/java/com/AttendanceManagementSystem/util/DBConnection.java
```

## User Authentication

- **Admin**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123#`
- **Students**: Use SRN format `PES2UG22CS123`, Password: `any` (follows pattern validation)
- **Teachers**: Use TRN format `TRN123`, Password: `any` (follows pattern validation)

## Project Structure

### Backend Components
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic
- **Repositories**: Handle database operations
- **Models**: Define data structure
- **Factories**: Create user objects based on role
- **Facades**: Simplify complex subsystems like authentication

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard views** for different user roles
- **Forms** for data input and management
- **Tables** for data display
- **Stats components** for attendance visualization
